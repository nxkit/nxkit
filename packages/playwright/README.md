ðŸ“¦ **Plug Playwright into your [Nx](https://nx.dev) workspace**

## Quick Start

Create an Nx workspace and add the Playwirght plugin

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace@latest my-org
npm install -D @nxkit/playwright
```

### Create a playwright E2E project

**Create an E2E project existing workspace project**

Create a web project in your workspace without a default e2e test runner. This is a `@nrwl/react` example:

```bash
npx nx generate @nrwl/react:app my-app --e2eTestRunner none
```

or, you can delete an existing e2e project, using:

```bash
npx nx generate @nrwl/workspace:rm --project my-app-e2e
```

Now, for this `my-app` project, you can create a Playwright e2e testing project using:

```bash
npx nx generate @nxkit/playwright:project my-app-e2e --frontendProject my-app
```

This will behave similar to what the official `@nrwl/cypress` plugin does. It will `serve` the `my-app` application, run e2e tests and provide the result.

**Standalone E2E project**

You can also create a Playwright E2E testing project without depending on an existing web project.

```bash
npx nx generate @nxkit/playwright:project my-app-e2e
```

This project won't run against a workspace project but against a given `baseUrl` instead. Check the `my-app-e2e/project.json` file to set your respective baseUrl.

### Run your E2E tests!

Run the `e2e` target for your e2e testing project

```bash
npx nx e2e my-app-e2e
```

See your tests report

```bash
npx nx show-report my-app-e2e
```

That's it!
